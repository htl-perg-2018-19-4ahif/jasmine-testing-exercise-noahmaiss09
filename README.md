# Testing

## Introduction

This application calculates VAT (German: Mehrwertsteuer) for invoices. A user can enter products and the application calculates and prints the invoice with calculated VAT results.

## Existing Code

The existing code in this application can be started, but it doesn't contain the necessary logic. However, the application contains *Jasmine* unit tests that you can run using `npm test`. Unfortunately, without the logic, most of the tests fail.

## Your Job

Your Job is to analyze the unit tests and add the necessary logic based on the test cases that you could find. The goal is that you become more familiar with *Jasmine* tests.

## Extra Points

* Earn one extra point if you check in your solution and send me a GitHub issue *with a screenshot* of your tests that are *all green*.
* Earn a second extra point if you add at least one additional test that makes sense. Mention the test that you wrote in a GitHub issue so that I know where to look at.

## Extra Challenge

Want to have an extra challenge? Try to add at least one additional *DOM Test* (see [*app.component.spec.ts*](src/app/app.component.spec.ts)) that makes sense. This challenge is optional and just for fun, you don't get extra points for it.
